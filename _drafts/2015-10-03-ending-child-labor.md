# Ending Child Labor

Many Americans likely believe that there is nothing they can do to help prevent child labor around the world. It’s not like you can easily find out what goods and services in a given country are made with child labor or forced labor, or what countries are doing, or should be doing, to address the problem of child labor and forced labor, right?  

Well, now there’s an app for that.

On September 20th, 2015, the Department of Labor released the 14th edition of the annual Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor report, and we also have brought our flagship reports on child labor and forced labor into the digital age. Along with the report, we launched _Sweat & Toil_, a new smartphone app that puts information from our reports on global child labor issues in the palm of your hand.

Just as importantly, we also threw open the gates to our massive reservoir of data on child and forced labor through our developer portal, putting over 1,000 pages of information on child labor and forced labor at the fingertips of creative people like you. We hope that these tools will amplify and maximize the impact of the work we are doing here at the department to address these issues.

The key idea here is this: transformative change can come from anywhere. Government doesn’t have all the answers and is only part of the solution. 

This work was a collaborative effort between the Department of Labor and the Presidential Innovation Fellowship. Round 3 Fellows - E J Kalafarski and Tyrone Grandison - led the development and deployment.

## How To Fight Child Labor

-	Ask Questions

Solving any problem starts with asking questions. For 14 years, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs has been asking questions about how we can work together as a global community to end child labor. This year’s report suggests several important steps, such as the critical importance of providing children with an adequate education and the urgent need to mainstream the elimination of child labor into broader development goals. There is no single solution to this issue, and eliminating child labor will require fresh ideas and new ways of thinking. You don’t have to be a full-time researcher or children’s rights advocate to ask these questions, either. Perhaps the next time a friend tells you about that great deal they got on a jacket, you’ll not only ask where they bought it, but about the working conditions in the country it came from . These are the kinds of questions that inspire action.

-	Take Action

Sharing the knowledge you’ve gained from our reports is a vital step toward meaningful change, and the new Sweat & Toil app is a fantastic tool for raising awareness. Because you don’t need the Internet to access the information it contains, you can use it to start a conversation about child labor in any corner of the world, from an office in Washington, D.C., to a backyard in Haiti. We at the department understand the importance of these conversations, which is why our report suggests country-specific actions governments can take to fight child labor, which we use to talk with them as we work together to address this global problem. 

-	Demand Change

Creating lasting change requires substantial efforts on the ground, where struggling families and children need help the most. The Department funds programs to help build the capacity of countries who want to take our suggested actions to protect their children, but need a little help. Programs like the Country Level Engagement and Assistance to Reduce Child Labor – or CLEAR – help us address countries’ requests for assistance in a nimble and targeted way, from establishing an Education Roadmap to Eliminate Child Labor in the Philippines to supporting efforts to develop child labor training materials for labor inspectors in Paraguay. But even when working together, governments can’t eliminate child labor by themselves. Everyone has an important role to play – including you.
