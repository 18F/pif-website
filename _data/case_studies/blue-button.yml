solution: "A team of PIFs, in partnership with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), VA, DoD, &amp; CMS to expand the Blue Button Initiatives including <a href='http://bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov/' target='_blank'>connector</a>, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) API standards for interoperability and a FHIR test server in <a href='http://sitenv.org/' target='_blank'>SITE</a> and CMS."
impact: "150 million Americans have access to their personalized health data; 600+ commitments from organizations to advance health information access efforts."
date: "2013 – ongoing"
quote: "The principle at the heart of Blue Button is that patients should be able to get secure access to their own data… That simple principle, if we follow as a country, can unlock all kinds of good for patients."
