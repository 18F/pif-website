title: SunShot Initiative
description: "A national collaborative effort to make solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity by the end of the decade."
challenge: "Make the total cost of solar energy fully economically-viable for everyday use, so that all Americans will benefit from this clean renewable energy resource."
solution: "The SunShot initiative focuses on making clean, low-cost reliable solar energy available for homeowners and communities, and create U.S. jobs through domestic solar manufacturing and distribution. A Fellow worked specifically on funding a range of projects that reduce the non-hardware, or soft-costs, of solar, which are becoming an increasingly larger fraction of the cost of installing solar."
impact: "The initiative is projected to save over $1.98 billion of taxpayer dollars by 2020, with a 1% decrease in 'soft costs'."
date: "2011 â€“ ongoing"
quote: "...the solar industry is actually adding jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy. They're good-paying jobs that are helping folks enter into the middle class..."
