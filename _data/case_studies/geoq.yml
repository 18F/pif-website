title: GeoQ
description: "An open source disaster response tool that crowdsources geo-tagged photos for collaborative, coordinated response."
challenge: "How to better use technology to help victims and communities of disasters more resilient in the aftermath of disaster."
solution: "Fellow Jaqueline Kazil, in coordination with National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other disaster analysts, built GeoQ to improve the speed and quality of disaster-related data coordination by using a data crowd-sharing framework. Programmers are able to use the existing services through GitHub, and add customizable features to alter GeoQ code for their own communities."
impact: "Currently, 12 local projects are leveraging the GeoQ platform to enable the use of geospatial intelligence in their communities."
date: "2014 – ongoing"
quote: "GeoQ enables us to merge multiple sources of imagery...and merge it very quickly. It’s another great example of how we can be innovative."
