quote: "Our troops and their spouses are proven leaders, highly-skilled and hard-working. Employers hiring them are getting the best this nation has to offer. Our service members transitioning to civilian life, as well as their spouses, deserve the resources they need to be successful. Through this effort, they are getting that help."
