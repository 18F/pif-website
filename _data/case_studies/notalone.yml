description: "An easy-to-read site which makes sexual assault resources readily accessible to students and schools."
challenge: "Improve the transparency and information-sharing of sexual assault prevention and enforcement data for students and schools."
solution: "In less than 30 days, a team of Presidential Innovation Fellows and 18F staff built NotAlone.gov, a website containing typically disparate and often difficult-to-find information for students, schools, and anyone interested in finding resources on how to prevent and respond to sexual assault on college campuses and in schools."
impact: "NotAlone.gov has received 500,000+ page views to date."
date: "2014 â€“ ongoing"
quote: "We need to provide survivors with more support and we need to bring perpetrators to more justice and we need colleges and universities to step up."
