# Presidential Innovation Fellows website

This is the PIF website, Jekyll edition (inspired by the [18F hub](https://github.com/18F/hub)). The website is currently maintained by PIF leadership, with contributions from fellows. The production site is hosted via [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/sites). Merges to the master branch will trigger a production deploy.
